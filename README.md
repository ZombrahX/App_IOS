# ProductCatalog iOS App

This project contains a basic SwiftUI application that fetches a list of products from an online service and displays them in a catalog. Users can mark items as favorites and add them to a cart. Both favorites and cart features are only stored in memory for demonstration purposes.

## Requirements
- Xcode 14 or later
- iOS 15 or later

## Running the App
1. Open `ProductCatalogApp` folder in Xcode as a new project or add the files to an existing project.
2. Build and run the app on the simulator or a physical device.

The home view shows a grid of products. Tapping a product opens a detail sheet. Favorites and cart can be accessed from the bottom tab bar.
